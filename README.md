# Machine Learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project. The primary goal of this project is to reproduce and validate the results presented in two competitive research papers related to intrusion detection.
The papers under consideration are:

1. **Paper1: Study on Decision Tree and KNN Algorithm for Intrusion Detection System**
2. **Paper2: Anomaly Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Probability Model to Implement Intrusion Detection System**

The experiments in this project utilize the NSL-KDD dataset, which is accompanied by a detailed description.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- **`documentation/`**: Contains the PDFs of the research papers.
- **`datasets/`**: Includes the NSL-KDD dataset with a detailed description.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks


## About the project

   **Explore the Papers:**

    -Read the papers in the `documentation/` directory to understand the methodology and algorithms proposed.

  **Data Understanding:**

    -Explore the dataset in the `datasets/` directory. 

   **CRISP-DM Phases:**

    -All phases of the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework are followed: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.
